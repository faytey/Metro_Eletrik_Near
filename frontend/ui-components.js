      <p>
        Your contract is storing a greeting message in the NEAR blockchain. To
        change it you need to sign in using the NEAR Wallet. It is very simple,
        just use the button below.

        Do not worry, this app runs in the test network ("testnet"). It works
        just like the main network ("mainnet"), but using NEAR Tokens that are
        only for testing!

      <ol>
        <li>
          Look in <code>frontend/App.js</code> - you'll see <code>getGreeting</code> and <code>setGreeting</code> being called on <code>contract</code>. What's this?
        </li>
        <li>
          Ultimately, this <code>contract</code> code is defined in <code>./contract</code> â€“ this is the source code for your <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/overview">smart contract</a>.</li>
        <li>
          When you run <code>npm run deploy</code>, the code in <code>./contract</code> gets deployed to the NEAR testnet. You can see how this happens by looking in <code>package.json</code>.</li>
